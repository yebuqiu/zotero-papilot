# Papilot

**An AI co-pilot for Zotero.** Selection translation, side-by-side PDF translation, library-wide Q&A, one-click reference import, automation rules, reading progress — one plugin for the whole "read the literature" loop.

> **Renamed in 0.55.0**: the project moved from **PaperPilot** to **Papilot** (repository `zotero-papilot`). The add-on ID, preference branch and local data files changed together; existing users should follow [section 8](#8-upgrading-from-paperpilot), which migrates settings and sessions automatically.

---

## 1. Introduction

Papilot is a third-party add-on running inside **Zotero 7–10**, positioned as a "literature co-pilot": Zotero collects and cites, Papilot handles everything after you open a PDF — understanding it, translating it, questioning it, turning conclusions into notes, and putting citations back into your library.

It consists of two parts that version independently:

| Part | What it is | Do you need to deploy it? |
|---|---|---|
| **The add-on** | `bootstrap.js` + `chrome/content/**`, a Manifest V2 extension with ~100 modules | No — install the `.xpi` and go |
| **Account & membership service** | Sign-up/sign-in, the official AI gateway, membership / billing / orders / admin console | **Not open-sourced here**; nothing to deploy for regular users, and the add-on works offline without it |

Three design rules:

- **Local-first**: papers, notes and reading history live in your Zotero library; only the AI requests and metadata lookups you explicitly trigger go online.
- **No model lock-in**: 14 channel presets (11 cloud vendors + local Ollama + official account + custom endpoint); translation additionally runs on 16 engines, 10 of which need no key.
- **Non-invasive**: every capability appears as a menu item, panel, column or dialog. Disable the plugin and Zotero behaves exactly as before.

---

## 2. Features

All entries are reachable from the **Feature Hub** (`Tools → Papilot ▸ → Papilot Feature Hub`). Below they are grouped exactly like the hub; the names in parentheses are the actual menu labels.

### 2.1 Reading (acts on the currently selected item)

- **AI Workbench**: standalone chat window that follows the main window's selection, streaming output, multiple sessions.
- **Summarize / Translate title & abstract / Deep interpretation**: a 300–500 word structured summary, an academic-tone translation that keeps terminology in English, and a five-part interpretation (problem / method / experiments / novelty / limitations) — each saved as a Zotero note.
- **PDF side-by-side translation (source | translation)**: original page on the left, the same page translated on the right, aligned paragraph by paragraph, figures and formulas preserved, synchronized scrolling, bilingual note export.
- **AI Chat floating window**: five triggers — `Ctrl+Shift+K` in the main window, the reader toolbar button, `Ctrl+Enter` in the reader, the item context menu, and the selection popup. Floating, edge-docked and split-window forms **share one session**.
- **Chat sidebar / Selection popup / PDF glance**: abstract and opening text appear in the right sidebar as soon as you select an item; selecting text in the reader translates, explains or follows up.
- **AI mind map**: hierarchical outline note, exportable as markmap `.md`.
- **Skill Store**: browse, install and author AI skill packs (prompt tags, glossaries, note templates, agent presets — declarative assets only).
- **Auto deep-read on import**: new items are summarized automatically and tagged `#AI精读` (off by default; daily cap and collection allow-list apply).

### 2.2 Search & Discovery (across the whole library)

- **Ask the library**: one question → two-stage retrieval (title/tag/abstract scoring, then full-text index verification) → the model answers from the candidates with clickable `[n]` citations; scope to the current collection, restrict to items with attachments, save the answer as a library-level note.
- **Retrieve only**: candidate list and matching snippets without calling the model.
- **Discovery (daily arXiv)**: build an interest profile from your library → pull the latest submissions by category → score and rank → automatically exclude items already in the library; results can be filed into an "arXiv recommendations" collection or saved as a note. Off by default.
- **Search subscriptions**: **subscribe by journal** — 525 built-in journals across 18 disciplines (Chinese aliases included, every ISSN verified). Search by name, abbreviation or ISSN and subscribe in one click — no RSS hunting, no query syntax. Journals outside the catalog can be found through OpenAlex (30k+ sources). You can also subscribe to a topic recommended from your library (including author tracking) or describe it in one sentence; preview before saving, then scheduled multi-source search (arXiv / OpenAlex / Crossref / Europe PMC / PubMed), de-duplicated import and a digest note.

### 2.3 Notes & Cards

- **Collect annotations** into one note; **AI interpretation of annotations** (what your highlights say about the through-line).
- **Note from template**: reading notes / close-reading cards / quick-read logs; templates are customizable.
- **AI flashcards to Anki**: generate Q/A cards from the full text and export Anki's import `.txt`.
- **Text side-by-side view (legacy entry)**: plain-text left/right view for cases without a text layer.
- **Note graph**: interactive graph of `zotero://` links and `[[wiki links]]` between items and notes; click a node to locate it in the main window.
- **Review Workbench**: multiple papers → outline → section drafts.

### 2.4 Batch Analysis (select 2+ items or a collection)

- **Compare PDFs**: up to 4 papers on screen (horizontal / vertical / 2×2), optional synchronized scroll and zoom, read-only preview of existing highlights.
- **AI literature matrix**: dimension-based comparison table note.
- **AI literature review**: a review paragraph with citation numbers across several papers.
- **Citation trace**: references / citing-papers analysis note.
- **Import references**: paste DOI, title, URL, PMID, arXiv ID or BibTeX — or jointly search Crossref / OpenAlex / PubMed / Europe PMC / arXiv / Semantic Scholar; automatic de-duplication, AI fills blanks without overwriting, export to BibTeX / EndNote.
- **Collection stats / Library report / Reading report**: per-collection counts, an HTML report of year–journal–author–tag distributions, and 30-day reading time with a calendar heatmap.

### 2.5 Library Health

- **Chinese literature**: parse CNKI/Wanfang-style filenames into metadata, fetch full Chinese metadata (public academic platform + CNKI, optionally with PDF), update CN translators, pass CNKI risk-control verification, **sign in with a personal CNKI account** (credentials stay local), match already-downloaded attachments by title.
- **Metadata**: fill missing fields via Semantic Scholar (never overwriting), normalization (DOI/date/title/URL), **metadata audit** (journal abbreviation ↔ full title, author-name normalization, DOI validity, required fields per item type, duplicate DOIs — checklist before fixing), **Metadata Doctor** (Crossref back-fill of DOI/journal/year with preview → confirm → undo).
- **Authenticity & cleanup**: fake-reference detection (hallucination check), verify a pasted reference list, smart cleanup (duplicates / missing attachments / missing metadata).
- **Attachments**: attachment doctor (no attachment, missing file, duplicate under the same parent, scanned PDFs without a text layer, storage orphans — **reports only, never deletes or moves**), rule-based renaming with `{author} - {year} - {title}`.
- **Full text**: Unpaywall (legal OA) first, then Sci-Hub / Sci-Net / publisher direct per settings; the resolvers can be injected into Zotero's native "Find Full Text".

### 2.6 Tags & State

- **AI auto-tagging**: structured JSON output + controlled vocabulary (reusing spellings already in your library) + confidence threshold + fingerprint cache.
- **Rule tagging**: line-based `tag | field | operator | value`, supporting `contains / !contains / regex / = / != / > / < / exists`.
- **Automation rules (trigger → condition → action)**: triggers are item import, PDF open, or manual on selected items; conditions combine 17 fields × 9 operators (regex included); actions tag, untag, write allow-listed fields, set reading state, add to a collection, run AI summary or AI tagging; includes a **dry run** that only counts matches.
- **Tag curator / normalization / nested tag view**: read-only report first (case, full-width/half-width, space vs hyphen variants, rare tags, missing parents), merge only after confirmation; `#a/b` hierarchy browsing is read-only.
- **Three reading states**: unread / reading / read, mutually exclusive; opening a PDF flips to "reading", and progress past the threshold flips to "read".

### 2.7 Integration

- **MCP server**: exposes the library as 10 MCP tools — `search_library`, `get_item`, `read_fulltext`, `list_annotations`, `create_note`, `list_collections`, `library_stats`, `list_recent`, `list_agent_tools`, `run_agent_tool` — for Claude Desktop, Cursor or your own agent. It rides Zotero's built-in local HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:23119`), so no extra process; **off by default**; once enabled every request needs a Bearer token, and write tools additionally require an explicit `allowWrite: true`.

### 2.8 Columns & Settings

- **Journal rank column**: easyScholar online data with offline fallback, Chinese and international systems (CAS tiers / PKU / CSCD / CSSCI / core), configurable badge count and colouring.
- **Citation column**: Semantic Scholar citation counts, refreshable.
- **Reading progress**: drawn directly into the **title column background** (one cell per page, darker the longer you read), fusing three sources (heartbeat page, Zotero's native last position, annotated pages); plus a sortable "reading progress" column.
- **Translated-title column / star rating column**.
- **Themes**: UI themes (standard / anime / landscape / animated wallpaper + custom image or video) and PDF reading themes (eye-care tint, night inversion, custom colour).
- **Menu customization**: `grouped` (default: quick-access items + 9 semantic groups) or `classic` (flat); hide groups, choose the three quick-access items.

### 2.9 Account (optional)

- Usable without signing in: translation, columns, themes, library health, automation and MCP are all local.
- When signed in: the official AI channel works without your own key, and you can review signed-in devices.
- You can also use your own API key or a local model and never create an account.

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Zotero | **7 / 8 / 9 / 10** (`strict_min_version 6.999`, `strict_max_version 99.*`) |
| OS | Windows / macOS / Linux |
| Account backend (self-hosted only) | Node ≥ 14; **zero third-party dependencies** |

### 3.2 Install the add-on

1. Download the latest `papilot-x.y.z.xpi` from [Releases](../../releases) (older builds are in `dist/`).
2. Zotero → **Tools → Add-ons** → **gear icon → Install Add-on From File…**
3. Pick the `.xpi`, restart Zotero.
4. Open **Settings → Papilot** and configure the AI channel as described in 3.3.

> Zotero updates third-party add-ons **silently**. Papilot checks the update manifest 15 seconds after startup and shows a native notification **only when a newer version really exists**, at most once per version.

### 3.3 First-run configuration (pick one)

| Mode | Steps | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| **Official account** | Settings → Papilot → Account → sign up / sign in; select the "Papilot account" channel | You don't want to obtain an API key |
| **Your own key** | Settings → Papilot → Channels → add a channel, pick a vendor preset and paste the key, or enter a custom base URL | You already have a vendor account |
| **Local model** | Channel `Ollama (local)`, base URL `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` | Fully offline |

Then run **Connection test** (`Tools → Papilot ▸ → Connection test`) to confirm.

### 3.4 Build from source

No bundler, no compile step:

```bash
python scripts/build-xpi.py 0.55.0     # → dist/papilot-0.55.0.xpi
```

The script checks that all sources exist, writes the zip, then re-opens it to assert "package contents == expected list" and prints the manifest version and entry count.

---

## 4. Running

### 4.1 The add-on (everyone)

It starts with Zotero; no extra process and no background daemon. Startup logs `Papilot startup` to **Help → Debug Output**, and self-check logs also go to `papilot-boot.log` in the Zotero data directory.

### 4.2 Account & membership service (not in this repository)

Sign-up/sign-in, the official AI gateway, and membership / billing / orders / admin console are commercial implementations and are **not open-sourced here** — that is why there is no `server/` directory and no backend launcher scripts in this repository.

The add-on does not depend on it: every offline feature (multi-engine translation, search & subscriptions, note cards, tagging, side-by-side PDF translation) works without signing in. Only the official AI channel needs the service; bring your own API key to stay fully local.

### 4.3 Public tunnel (only when self-hosting a service)

The repository keeps `scripts/tunnel/` and its start/stop helpers so a self-hosted service can be exposed to the internet. If you do not run a service, you never need them.

### 4.4 Where data lives

| Content | Location |
|---|---|
| Preferences | Zotero prefs `extensions.zotero.papilot.*` (197 entries) |
| Login session | `papilot-account.json` (plus `.1` / `.2` rolling copies), in both the Zotero data directory and the profile directory |
| Chat history / journal cache / reading stats / progress | `papilot-chat-sessions.json`, `papilot-easyscholar.json`, `papilot-rank-config.json`, `papilot-s2-citations.json` in the same directories |
| Papers, notes, attachments | Always inside the Zotero library — the plugin never copies or moves them |

---

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Menu layout

- **Tools menu**: a single `Papilot ▸` entry (feature hub + group shortcuts) plus a separate "Papilot Settings".
- **Item context menu**: `grouped` by default — up to 3 quick-access items on top (default: "AI Summary", "PDF side-by-side translation") followed by 9 semantic groups: AI Reading / Notes & Export / Citation Analysis / Tags / Metadata / Chinese Literature Tools / Automation / Reading State / Rating.
- **Toolbar button**: one button in the item toolbar that opens the same quick items + hub + settings (can be disabled).
- Anything folded away is still reachable from **the hub / the Tools menu groups / classic flat mode**.

### 5.2 Six typical workflows

1. **Reading a foreign paper**: select the item → right-click "PDF side-by-side translation" → original left, translation right, translated as you scroll; use "translate whole document" inside the window when needed.
2. **Reading with questions**: `Ctrl+Shift+K` opens the chat overlay (locked to the current item) → multi-turn follow-ups → "save as note".
3. **Asking the whole library**: hub → Ask the library → type the question → follow the `[n]` citations back to the items.
4. **Cleaning metadata in bulk**: select items → Metadata audit → review the issue list → tick → apply; use Metadata Doctor for a reversible preview first.
5. **Building an automation rule**: Automation rules → new rule "on import → title contains X → tag + set state" → dry run → enable.
6. **Handing the library to an external agent**: Settings → MCP → enable → copy the client JSON → paste into Claude Desktop / Cursor.

### 5.3 Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K` | Open the AI chat overlay from the main window |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` | Open the chat overlay from the reader |
| `↑` / `↓` | Browse question history in the overlay |
| `Esc` | Close the overlay |

Rebind or disable them in **Settings → Papilot → Hotkeys**; individual automation rules can also carry their own shortcut.

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 MCP client configuration

After enabling MCP in **Settings → Papilot → MCP**, the window shows a ready-to-copy JSON block (the token is generated on first use and can be reset):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "papilot": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:23119/papilot/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your token>" }
    }
  }
}
```

A tool call (JSON-RPC):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "search_library", "arguments": { "query": "tic disorder TCM", "limit": 5 } }
}
```

### 7.2 Custom AI channel

Adding a channel in the settings panel is the recommended path; the equivalent `aiChannels` structure is (`active` points at a channel id):

```json
{
  "active": "ds",
  "channels": [
    {
      "id": "ds",
      "name": "DeepSeek",
      "provider": "deepseek",
      "baseUrl": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
      "apiKey": "sk-...",
      "model": "deepseek-chat",
      "models": ["deepseek-chat", "deepseek-reasoner"],
      "timeoutMs": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

`provider` is one of the built-in preset ids (`deepseek` / `qwen` / `glm` / `kimi` / `doubao` / `yi` / `ernie` / `minimax` / `siliconflow` / `spark` / `hunyuan` / `ollama` / `custom`) or `official`, whose base URL and key are injected from your session and never stored.

### 7.3 Rule-tagging syntax

`Settings → Papilot → Tagging & automation → Rule tagging`, one rule per line:

```
# tag | field | operator | value
# fields: title publicationTitle journalAbbreviation abstractNote year itemType DOI creators
# operators: contains !contains regex = != > < exists
#method/machine-learning | abstractNote | contains | machine learning
#domain/cardiology | publicationTitle | regex | (?i)heart|cardio
#recent | year | > | 2023
```

Lines starting with `//` or `#` are comments.

### 7.4 Glossary

`Settings → Papilot → Translation → Glossary`, one `source = target` per line (`=>` and tab separators also work; a JSON array is accepted too). Domain-aware form adds a third segment:

```
Transformer = transformer | Computer Science;AI
myocardial infarction = myocardial infarction | Medicine
```

The domain allow-list is `translateGlossaryDomains` (semicolon-separated; empty = all domains enabled; general entries without a domain are never filtered out). The glossary participates in the translation cache key via its content fingerprint and is injected into the LLM prompt so terminology stays consistent across the paper.

---

## 8. Upgrading from PaperPilot

0.55.0 is a brand-level rename; all of the following changed together:

| Item | Old | New |
|---|---|---|
| Add-on name | PaperPilot 文献副驾 | **Papilot 文献副驾** |
| Add-on ID | `paperpilot@dev.local` | `papilot@dev.local` |
| Preference branch | `extensions.zotero.paperpilot.*` | `extensions.zotero.papilot.*` |
| Data files | `paperpilot-*.json` | `papilot-*.json` |
| Repository | `paper-pilot` | `zotero-papilot` |

**Steps** (the add-on ID changed, so the old version will not auto-update):

1. Zotero → Tools → Add-ons → **remove** the old PaperPilot.
2. Install `papilot-0.55.0.xpi` and restart.
3. On first start a one-shot migration copies user values from the old preference branch to the new one and copies 7 old data files under their new names (guarded by `brandMigrated`; the old files are kept).
4. If a setting did not carry over, the old value is still on disk — re-enter it.

---

## 9. Privacy & Data

- **Offline by default**: apart from the AI requests, metadata lookups and update checks you trigger, nothing is uploaded; each of those can be disabled or narrowed in settings.
- **Credentials stay local**: AI keys, CNKI and third-party source accounts live in local prefs; the login session token is stored as JSON in the data directory (never in prefs, never in git).
- **Three MCP constraints**: off by default, bound to `127.0.0.1` only, Bearer token on every request; write tools additionally require explicit authorization.
- **Uninstalling keeps data**: the files above are not deleted on uninstall; remove them manually if you want them gone.

---

## 10. Development

```bash
# Quick gate (syntax + generated-asset sync + all Node tests + wiring scan, ~2.5 min)
python scripts/preflight.py --fast

# Full gate (adds browser E2E; needs NODE_PATH pointing at playwright-core)

## 11. FAQ

**Nothing happens after installing?**
Make sure Zotero is 7 or newer. `Help → Debug Output` should show `Papilot startup`. On `STARTUP FAILED`, please attach the stack trace to an issue.

**The AI keeps spinning?**
Run "Connection test" first. Common causes: unreachable endpoint, invalid key, exhausted key quota, or a wrong model name inside the channel.

**Translation is empty or garbled?**
Scanned PDFs have no text layer — run the attachment doctor or Zotero OCR. Masked inline formulas are expected.

**I updated but the version did not change?**
Add-on updates are silent replacements and need a **Zotero restart**; Papilot shows a notice once when it detects a newer version.

**Does it upload my papers?**
Only the text fragments needed for a request you explicitly triggered, to the endpoint you configured. There is no background bulk upload.

**The progress bar does not appear?**
Check that `progressRowEnabled` is true (the default) and that the item has a PDF with a known page count; EPUBs have no page numbers, so progress is tracked by CFI.
